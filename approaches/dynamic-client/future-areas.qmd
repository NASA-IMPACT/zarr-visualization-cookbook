The benchmarking results and recommendations detailed in this cookbook motivates several possible avenues of exploration:

1. Performance improvements for ndpyramid to reduce post-processing costs.
2. Generalize ndpyramid to better support other mapping approaches.
3. Integration between ndpyramid and pangeo-forge-recipes to support generating pyramids during dataset creation.
4. Extending the dynamic client approach to visualize datasets without pyramids.
5. Formalizing the representation of pyramids and spatial overviews through a Zarr Enhancement Proposal (ZEP) on multiscales.
6. Extending the dynamic client approach to visualize COGs using Kerchunk.
7. Generalizing the dynamic client approach as a plug-in for general solutions like Mapbox or deck.gl.
8. Supporting and benchmarking additional compression algorithms, data types, and bitrounding.
