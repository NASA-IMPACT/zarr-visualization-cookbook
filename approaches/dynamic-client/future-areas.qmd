The benchmarking results and recommendations detailed in this cookbook motivates several possible avenues of exploration:

1. Performance improvements for ndpyramid to reduce post-processing costs.
2. Integration between ndpyramid and pangeo-forge-recipes to support generating pyramids during dataset creation.
3. Extending the dynamic client approach to visualize datasets without pyramids.
4. Formalizing the representation of pyramids and spatial overviews through a Zarr Enhancement Proposal (ZEP) on multiscales.
5. Extending the dynamic client approach to visualize COGs using Kerchunk.
6. Generalizing the dynamic client approach as a plug-in for general solutions like Mapbox or deck.gl.
7. Supporting and benchmarking additional compression algorithms, data types, and bitrounding.
