title: Approaches
---

For browser-based visualization of Zarr, there are 2 approaches covered in this report:

1. [Tiling](./tiling.qmd)
2. [Dynamic client](./dynamic-client.qmd)

The tiling approach is to run a tile server which provides an interoperable API with multiple interfaces. Also the response delivered to the client is an image, not the raw data itself. The dynamic client approach has access to the underlying data and thus maximum flexibility in rendering and analysis for the user.
