## Dynamic Client - Pros

* You donâ€™t have to run a server
* Numeric data available for time series, color mapping, spatial aggregation, etc.

## Dynamic Client - Cons

* Custom library
* Pre-processing requirements

## Tile server - Pros

* Serves standard tiling APIs (xyz and tiles): The tiles can be served with various map platforms and take advantage of their features (ex. Mapbox v2 projection) 
* Can be used with anything that is xarray-readable, including [kerchunk](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/) reference files

## Tile server - Cons

* Serves image tiles, not data
* New requests need to be made to visualize different variables
